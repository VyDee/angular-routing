Route's Data Property

A route definition has a data property, used to provide
arbitrary data to a route. We pass it an object specifying
a set of key and value pairs, where the key is a logical 
name for the data and the value is the data itself.

The data defined in the data property can not change 
throughout the lifetime of the lifetime of the application,
so we use it for a static data such as the pageTitle.

To read the data property, we use the same activated route
service in the module. We use its snapshot to access the 
data array, using the key to retrieve a specific data
element. We won't use observable because the data property
is static and won't change so there is no need to watch for
changes

(angular module)
    @NgModule({
        imports: [
            RouterModule.forChild([
            {
                path: 'products',
                component: ProductListComponent,
                data: { pageTitle: 'Product List'}
            },
            {
                path: 'products/:id',
                component: ProductDetailComponent
            }
            ])
        ]
    })...

(component class)
    this.pageTitle = this.route.snapshot.data['pageTitle'];
