Using a route resolver
    1/ Build a route resolver service
        -- A route resolver is a custom Angular service
        that retrieves the data needed for our component
    2/ Add resolve to the route configuration
        -- assign it to the route resolver. The router
        executes the resolver services and retrieves the
        data before activating the associated component
    3/ Read the data from ActivatedRoute
        -- since we have the needed data, we modified the 
        associated component to read its data from the
        activated route service, similar to how we retrieve
        route parameters. We read that data using a snapshot
        or an observable.
        -- We use the snapshot to read the data from the
        activated route service if we don't expect resolver
        to get different data while staying on the current 
        page
        -- we use observable to read the data from the
        activated route service if it is possible for the
        resolver to get different data while staying on 
        the current page
