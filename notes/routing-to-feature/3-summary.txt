Routing to Features Checklist: 

>> Configuration
    Import RouterModule
        - Be sure to use RouterModule.forChild()
    
    Configure the routes
    Order matters!
    --> Example can be found at (app.module.ts) and 
    (app-routing.module.ts)

>> Naming routes    
    use a common root path name for related feature routes
        - products
        - products/:id
        - products/:id/edit

>> Activate with Code
    - import the Router
    - add a dependency on the Router service
        As a constructor parameter
    - use the router service navigate method
    - pass in a link parameters array
        * first element if the root Url segment
        * all other elements are route parameters or additional
        Url segments
        >> this.router.navigate(['/welcome]);

>> Routing module
    -- separate out routes to their own routing module
    -- keep route path order in mind
