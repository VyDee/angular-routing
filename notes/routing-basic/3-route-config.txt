Route configuration
    -- define a set of compoenents and the route segment
    required tp activate the component and displaying the 
    component template

    -- Routing is basically transitioning from one route 
    path to another.

    -- Route configurations is an array of route objects.
    Each route object includes a path and other properties.

    --The "path" property identifies the URL segment or 
    segments for the route. Anytime the address bar URL
    changes, the router searches the list looking for a 
    match between the path property and the current URL
    segments. We can also see the component associated with
    this route.

    -- important notes:
        --The order of the route matters
        --more specific path should be before an abstract path
        
    Example:
    [
        //path: welcome using Welcome Component
        { path: 'welcome' , component: WelcomeComponent }, 

        //path: empty or blank, redirect back to welcome
        { path: ' ', redirectTo: 'welcome', pathMatch: 'full' },

        //if path is undefined, direct to 404PageNotFound
        { path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }
    ]
