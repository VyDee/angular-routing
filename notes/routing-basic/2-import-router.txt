            associate a style with the active router link

Importing the Angular Router
    1/ import the RouterModule into "imports" in (app.module.ts)

RouterModule.forRoot() vs RouterModule.forChild()
    >> RouterModule.forRoot()
        -- Declares the router directives
        -- Manages our route configuration
        -- Registers the router service
        -- Used once for the application
    
    >> RouterModule.forChile()
        -- Declares the router directives
        -- Manages our route configuration
        -- Does NOT register the router service
        -- Used in feature modules

Notes:
    >> BrowserModule: used to pull in basic directives such
    as NgIf and NgFor

    >> HttpClientModule to access the Http client services and
    get and save data

    >> InMemoryWebApiModule is a separate service provided as
    part of the Angular documentation. We use it to simulate 
    call to a back end Web service to get and save product data 
    without the need to set up a back end Web server
