    -- Check criteria before leaving a route
    -- Commonly used to:
        - Check for unsaved changes
        - Confirm leaving an incomplete operation
    -- Called when the Url changes to a different route

For example: the user goes to Product Edit, make changes and
navigate away, their changes are lost. so we want to use this 
to check for their unsaved changes and confirm before leaving
the page
