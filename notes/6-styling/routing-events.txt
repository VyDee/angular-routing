Routing Events
    -- NavgationStart : triggers when navigation begins
    -- RouteRecognized: triggers when the router has found
    a valid path in the configuration that matches the parsed
    URL
    -- NavigationEnd : triggers when navigation ends successfully
    -- NavigationCancel: triggers when navigation is cancelled, 
    such as by a routing guard or redirect
    -- NavigationError: triggers when navigation failed

We can enable RouteTracing to see all the routing Events
    (app-routing.module.ts)
    imports: [
        RouterModule.forRoot([
            { path: 'welcome', component: WelcomeComponent},
            { path: '', redirectTo: 'welcome', pathMatch: 'full'},
            { path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }
          ], { enableTracing: true}),
    ],
