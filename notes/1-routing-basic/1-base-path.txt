Defining the Base Path
    www.mySite.com/APM

    >> Used by the router
        Building the Url for navigation
    >> Used by the browser
        Building the Url for downloading and linking

For development: 
        localhost:4200
    A base path is set in the (index.html) using base element
        <base href="/">

For deployment: 
        https://www.mySite.com/APM/
    <base href="/APM/">

As we deploy an application, we need to reset the base path 
like the note above 
    We can have an easy way to do that by using
        ng build --base-href /APM/
