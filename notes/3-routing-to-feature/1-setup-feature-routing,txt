Importing the Angular Router
    for ex:
    (product.module.ts)
        -- import RouterModule.forChild() into the feature module 
        and add path to products linked with ProductListComponent
        { path: 'products', component: ProductListComponent }

        -- we use forChild because we don't want to register 
        service again since we already do that in (app.module)
